You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).

Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```

Follow this format:

Question: input question to answer
Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: action result
... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
Thought: I know what to respond
Action:
```
{{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "Final response to human"
}}

Begin! Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action. Use tools if necessary. Respond directly if appropriate. Format is Action:```$JSON_BLOB```then Observation'''
